description: PHP and Twig rules for Cartly
globs:
  - "**/*.php"
  - "**/*.twig"
---
- Use Eloquent models and existing services; keep controllers thin.
- Validate inputs server-side before writes.
- For Twig, prefer existing filters (currency/local_date) and avoid inline PHP.
- Keep forms CSRF-protected and use required fields.
- Resolve controllers from the PHP-DI container; avoid manual instantiation in routes.
