globs:
  - "**/*"
---
- Prefer minimal, explicit changes; avoid unrelated edits.
- Keep admin routes under /admin and use /admin/login as the only login entrypoint.
- Shop setup routes live under /admin/setup and require setup.access permission.
- Use existing helpers/services instead of duplicating logic.
- Keep templates ASCII unless file already uses Unicode.
- Place stateless utilities in src/Helpers, side-effect classes in src/Services, and builders in src/Factories.
- Use PHP-DI container for controllers/services instead of manual instantiation.
