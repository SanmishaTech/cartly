description: UI and styling rules for Cartly
globs:
  - "**/*.twig"
  - "src/assets/css/**"
---
- Use DaisyUI components/classes for consistency.
- Keep admin UI layouts under core/admin and use existing layouts/partials.
- Keep form fields labeled with matching for/id and include CSRF tokens.
- Prefer simple, readable layouts; avoid excessive nesting.
- Maintain hover styles on tables and consistent spacing utilities.
